            I am a young enthusiast who is keen on IT and anything about it
            since my first steps to High School. During the past few years, I
            gained lots of experience in this field due to the strong desire of
            becoming an expert in my field. I&apos;m pretty swift at learning
            new technologies which has contributed to my adaptive skills, easily
            adapting to new environments and new tech. â€œFor me, frontend
            development is more than coding. It&apos;s a canvas with a blank
            page and I am the artist to paint it with colors of coding. NOW!
            WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO PAINT?
